# Moemon Emerald Kai Co-op: notes for Claude

Native PC build of Moemon Emerald Kai v1.0 with online 4-player co-op and PvP.
Based on Kurausukun's `pc_port` branch of pret/pokeemerald (commit 1165825), SDL2.

Read `BUILDING_COOP.md` first for the architecture and build steps. The player
docs are in `dist_extras/README.txt` (shipped next to the exe).

## Key locations
- `src/mp/`: all co-op code (net, client, avatar, overworld, trainer mode, battle, menu)
- `include/mp.h`: shared co-op API. `src/mp/mp_net.h` holds the protocol (bump `MP_PROTOCOL_VERSION` on changes)
- `tools/mp_server/`: standalone relay server
- `tools/moemon_import/`: scripts that imported the Kai IPS into the decomp (need the user's ROM; not in the repo)
- `graphics/moemon/`: Kai battle sprite and palette blobs (INCBIN'd)
- Hooks in stock files are marked `Moemon Co-op` / `Moemon Kai` (grep for them)

## Building
- Linux: `make linux -j$(nproc)` (needs libsdl2-dev and libpng-dev)
- Windows: `make winwsl -j$(nproc)` with x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc and the SDL2 mingw package in ./SDL2

## Headless testing
`src/platform/sdl2.c` has a test harness: `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy MOEMON_TEST=script.txt MOEMON_SHOTDIR=dir`
(commands: wait N, press KEYS N, mash KEYS COUNT INTERVAL, shot NAME, quit).
`MOEMON_DEBUG_QUICKSTART=1` (+ `MOEMON_DEBUG_NAME/GENDER/WARP/PARTY/MONEY`) skips the intro.
`MOEMON_COOP_CONFIG=x.ini` and `MOEMON_SAVE=x.sav` let several clients run on one machine.
`MOEMON_TEST_FPS=120` keeps several clients roughly in sync.
Verified this way: 4-player overworld sync, nametags, custom PNG sprite,
BATTLE FLAG -> spot -> walk up -> link battle -> rewards and whiteout, save/continue.

Two-client tests: `MOEMON_LOBBY=127.0.0.1:PORT` plus `MOEMON_COOP_AUTO=host:NAME` / `join:NAME`
and a local `tools/mp_server` build. `MOEMON_DEBUG_PARTY=280:15+` makes a Pokémon one EXP
point short of leveling. Also verified: HOST/JOIN with passwords, sprite packs seen by others,
spectating, co-op Double Battles (accept, decline, one-Pokémon trainer, win with evolutions
and move learning, loss, disconnect).
Follower Pokémon (SELECT in the party menu): local trailing, 64x64 sprites, talking to it,
and remote followers seen by the other client.
Phase 1 co-op: emotes/phrases (bubbles seen remotely), FRIENDS > GO TO, Town/Fly map heads, door
labels, shared Pokédex (+ CAUGHT BY), buddy bonus, co-op Roxanne win giving both players the badge
(test: MOEMON_DEBUG_WARP=11,3,5,3 / 11,3,5,4, MOEMON_DEBUG_PARTY=283:46, `mp badges`).
Phase 2: shared PC (put/take Pokémon and items, `MOEMON_STORE_DIR`), trade with money/items and a
trade evolution (Kadabra), daily gift + thank-you bonus. Battle Flag hides name tag and follower.
Phase 3 (mp_events.c, mp_gatcha.c): goals/toasts/MoeGatcha/streak with `mp event ...`, `mp savedata`,
`mp goals`, MOEMON_DEBUG_DATE; partner-by-partner co-op goal checked with three clients (run4-style).
Phase 4: co-op wild battles (mp_coop.c, `MP_Coop_TryWildTeamUp`): a land encounter pulls in the closest
free friend standing in grass within 8x6 tiles (no prompt), 2 players vs 1 wild Pokémon (the right
opponent slot starts absent). POKé BALLS work (only balls); the catch goes to the thrower via the
result message. Test: Route 101 grass, MOEMON_DEBUG_WARP=0,16,12,11 / 0,16,14,11, `mp wild 288:3`,
`mp item 1 2`, `waitfor action`, `mp party`. Verified: catch by the joining player, knock-out win
(EXP for both), friend out of range -> normal single battle. Also gym rematches and tournaments.

Batch 3 (mp_linkx.c): record mixing over relay (record_mixing.c MP_RecordMix_*, mp_battle.c
NetLink_BeginRecordMix fakes a 2-4 player link), friend Secret Base visits (secret_base.c MP_SecretBase_*,
EventScript_MpVisitSecretBase), link Trainer Cards, Day Care co-op eggs (daycare.c MP_Daycare_TryCoopEgg,
`<save>.coopegg`), shared roamer/weather, Hall of Fame friend teams. Debug: `mp mkbase 181`, `mp daycare N`,
`mp coopegg`, `mp takeegg`, `mp hof`, `mp roamer`, `mp world`. All verified with two clients.
No UNION ROOM page any more: CO-OP > FRIENDS > a friend (mp_linkx.c MP_Linkx_OpenFriend) has GO TO, TRAINER CARD,
VISIT SECRET BASE; CO-OP > BERRY GAMES (MP_Linkx_OpenUnion) has the blender and crush. Mixing is automatic only.
Minigames (mp_minigame.c): BERRY BLENDER (berry_blender.c NPC mode with friends in the seats, leader syncs
arrow/speed/progress and final numbers) and BERRY CRUSH (a relay stand-in for the RFU calls via macros at the top
of berry_crush.c). Debug: `mp blender`, `mp crush`, `mp pokeblocks`, condition `crushask`. Link CONTESTS
(mp_grouplink.c): a 2-4 player link behind the NetLink_* calls (link.c) + matchmaking in TryContestEModeLinkup.
Test: MOEMON_DEBUG_WARP=13,4,15,4 on both, UP UP, mash A. All verified with two clients.

## Not yet done or verified
- The Windows exe has never been run on real Windows (it was cross-compiled)
- Only POKé BALLS (co-op wild battles) can be used in co-op battles; no items in PvP
- Remote players aren't shown across warps (only the same map or connected maps)
